Thor: Platform Game in Java
Welcome to Thor!

Created: April-June 2011
Update 1: November 9, 2014
Update 2: November 10, 2015

To run the game:

- Since I have not yet made this project with an executable, so to run this game, run ThorRunner.java with any Java IDE.

- I've run this game in both JCreator and Eclipse

- Possible Errors: 
  - Make sure to run this game in JRE - J2SE-1.5 (Later versions are not compatible with some parts)
  - Make sure the gridworld.jar file is added (add external .jar file). The .jar file is included.

Thor:

- platform game with controllable character Thor

- spacebar - throw hammer (hammer will return to you after it hits wall or disappears if
             if hits an enemy)

- use arrow keys to move and the up arrow to jump

- after all enemys are dead, the final boss will appear



Comments:

- If there is any problems running it, please email me at jameshe2018@u.northwestern.edu and I'll be more than happy to help!

- I apologize in advance if this game looks a bit crude. I wrote this when I was 
  14 and I tried to update it these past few weeks to make it more appealing
